## Mentions and Thanks
Mainly followed [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-100-days-of-code-bot-for-discord-using-typescript-and-mongodb/) tutorial but with a different perspective in mind 😈 

There are a **couple of changes** on the discord API since the post was written

Thanks for the community of Habitus est Omnia for helping me test this 😄
